# READ ME BEFORE ANYTHING

Hi guys good luck with ur deving lol

**Unity version must be 6000.3.0f1 or the whole thing will be cooked**

Also uhh when you start the project if you see this warning:

<p align="center">
  <img src="Assets/warning.png" alt="Step 1"/>
</p>

**PRESS *NO* OR YOU WILL BE COOKED**

Aside from that when you try to run the game run it from the level or safeArea scene because the main menu is cooked

if you want to pattern that, be my guest!!

I think that's all, there are comments in the different scripts that explain them briefly but glhf!! 🥳
