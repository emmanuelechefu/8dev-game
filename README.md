# READ ME BEFORE ANYTHING

Hi guys good luck with ur deving lol

**Unity version must be 6000.3.0f1 or the whole thing will be cooked**

Also uhh when you start the project if you see this warning:

<p align="center">
  <img src="Assets/warning.png" alt="Step 1"/>
</p>

**PRESS *NO* OR YOU WILL BE COOKED**

Aside from that when you try to run the game run it from the level or safeArea scene because the main menu is cooked

if you want to pattern that, be my guest!!

I think that's all, there are comments in the different scripts that explain them briefly but glhf!! 🥳

Didn't wanna delete any of Eman's part so I'm just adding mine below

To summarise, this game is made INCREDIBLY stupid, not utilising one of unity's best features. My main pet peeve, the maps.
They are generated from txt files and assets are loaded over them (by me). Even worse cuz the levelManager code needs
9 files to load in fully and form a 3x3 grid (rommMaps 0-8). So yeah have fun with adding more, ideally just design ur 
own (like I did with bossRoom.txt) and go from there. Or, redesign everything and actually make maps in the scene creator
(long as hell but if u do ur goated).

The boss is incomplete cuz lowkey someone else got that fr, my idea was a bullet hell boss but this is where I ended
so there's literally nothing there so do what u want. Also no doors lead to there yet, u got that tho.

Also, that warning in Eman's part should be fixed and the warning shouldn't come up, but if it does just click no.
If it does then you also won't have the right input manager setup so you will need to go to here:
- Edit -> Project Settings -> Player -> Active Input Handling and set it to Both
If you don't do this the main menu won't work.

Final note, there's a lot I didn't explain intentionally cuz screw you, go through my pain and figure it out urself.
Feel free to change whatever you want, even assets cuz i lowkey just grabbed generic ass ones while making it.
Also, add hentai, you know you want to.

Oh yeah, the game is runnable from the main menu, I made it. Feel free to make it *worse*.
